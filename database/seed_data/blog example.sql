Best for clean builds.\r\n\r\n    Semi-Modular: Some fixed cables, some removable.\r\n\r\n    Non-Modular: All cables permanently attached.\r\n\r\n⚠️ Connectors\r\n\r\n    Ensure it has:\r\n\r\n        24-pin ATX (motherboard)\r\n\r\n        8-pin CPU EPS\r\n\r\n        PCIe 6+2-pin or 12VHPWR (for modern GPUs)\r\n\r\n        SATA/Molex for drives and accessories\r\n\r\n🖥️ Step 3: Gather Tools & Prepare for Install\r\n\r\nYou’ll need:\r\n\r\n    PSU\r\n\r\n    Case with a PSU shroud or mount\r\n\r\n    Phillips screwdriver\r\n\r\n    Cable ties (optional for clean cable management)\r\n\r\n🔧 Step 4: Install the PSU\r\n\r\n    Orient the PSU: Fan facing down (if the case has bottom ventilation).\r\n\r\n    Slide into the PSU chamber (usually bottom rear of the case).\r\n\r\n    Align the screw holes and secure with 4 screws.\r\n\r\n    Connect PSU cables:\r\n\r\n        24-pin to motherboard\r\n\r\n        8-pin (or 4+4) EPS to CPU\r\n\r\n        PCIe to GPU\r\n\r\n        SATA/Molex to drives or RGB/fans\r\n\r\n    Tidy up cables: Route through case cutouts, use ties for airflow.\r\n\r\n⚡ Step 5: Test and Power On\r\n\r\n    Plug the power cable into the PSU and turn the rear switch to “|”.\r\n\r\n    Press the power button.\r\n\r\n    If nothing powers on, double-check cable connections, especially CPU and motherboard power.\r\n\r\n🛒 Recommended PSU Specs for 2025 Builds\r\n\r\nWhile PSU models vary by region, here’s a guide based on your system needs:\r\nBuild Type\tSuggested PSU\r\nBudget build w/ iGPU\t450–550W 80+ Bronze\r\nMid-range (e.g., RX 7700)\t650W 80+ Gold Modular\r\nHigh-end (e.g., RX 9070 XT)\t850–1000W 80+ Gold/Platinum Modular\r\n🔹 Example: Building with MSI Radeon RX 9070 XT\r\n\r\n💡 GPU requires ~300–350W on its own\r\n\r\n    Go for at least 850W, 80+ Gold certified\r\n\r\n    Look for 12VHPWR or dual 8-pin PCIe cables\r\n\r\n    Brands like Corsair, Seasonic, MSI, and EVGA make solid PSUs\r\n\r\n🧠 Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nNever cheap out on a PSU. A poor-quality power supply can destroy components, cause random shutdowns, or limit future upgrades. A reliable, efficient, modular PSU keeps your PC safe and running at its best.', '2', '2025-07-16 16:02:11'),

('18', '❄️ How to Choose and Install a CPU Cooler: Keep Your PC Cool and Quiet', 'Your CPU cooler plays a vital role in your system’s performance and longevity. Whether you’re gaming, editing, or just browsing, keeping your processor cool helps prevent thermal throttling, lowers noise, and can even extend the life of your components.\r\n\r\nThis guide shows you how to choose the right cooler and install it the right way—air or liquid.\r\n🧠 Step 1: What Does a CPU Cooler Do?\r\n\r\nA CPU cooler dissipates heat generated by your processor. Without proper cooling, your CPU will run hot, slow itself down, or even shut off to protect itself.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of CPU coolers:\r\n🔹 Air Coolers\r\n\r\n    Use a heatsink and fan to transfer heat\r\n\r\n    Reliable and budget-friendly\r\n\r\n    Easier to install and maintain\r\n\r\n🔹 Liquid Coolers (AIOs)\r\n\r\n    Use liquid and a pump to move heat to a radiator\r\n\r\n    Quieter under heavy load\r\n\r\n    Better thermal performance for high-end CPUs\r\n\r\n    Require more space and planning\r\n\r\n🧩 Step 2: Choose the Right Cooler for Your CPU\r\n\r\nDifferent CPUs have different cooling needs.
